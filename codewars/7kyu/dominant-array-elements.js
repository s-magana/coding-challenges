// An element in an array is dominant if it is greater than all elements to its right. You will be given an array and your task will be to return a list of all dominant elements. For example:

// solve([1,21,4,7,5]) = [21,7,5] because 21, 7 and 5 are greater than elments to their right. 
// solve([5,4,3,2,1]) = [5,4,3,2,1]

// Notice that the last element is always included. All numbers will be greater than 0.
// More examples in the test cases.

// Good luck!

// My solution: 
function solve(arr) {
    return arr.filter((e, i, a) => a.slice(i + 1).every(f => e > f))
}
