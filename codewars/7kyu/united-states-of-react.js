// United State of React
// Some say The United States has never been so divided. This Kata is a chance for you to unite a once great nation and MAKE AMERICA CODE AGAIN!

// What's Involved
// State
// Changing State
// Conditional Rendering based on state
// The challenge
// You will be given a component called States. You will need to establish an initial state for the component called united and for it to be set to false.

// Then write a unite function that changes this state to true.

// Then conditionally render a bespoke message in the component.

// If the States are united then display "Code for everyone"

// If the States aren't united then display "Make America code again"

// My solution:
import React from 'react';

export class States extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super(); 
    
    this.state = { united: false }
  }
  
  unite = () => {
    this.setState({ united: true })
  }
  
  render() {
    const { united } = this.state  

    return (
    <div className="status">
      <span>{ united ? "Code for everyone" : "Make America code again"}</span>
    </div>
    )
  } 
}
