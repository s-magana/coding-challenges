// You are working at a lower league football stadium and you've been tasked with automating the scoreboard.

// The referee will shout out the score, you have already set up the voice recognition module which turns the ref's voice into a string, but the spoken score needs to be converted into a pair for the scoreboard!

// e.g. "The score is four nil" should return [4,0]

// Either teams score has a range of 0-9, and the ref won't say the same string every time e.g.

// "new score: two three"
  
// "two two"
  
// "Arsenal just conceded another goal, two nil"
// Please rate and enjoy!

// My solution: 
function scoreboard(string) {
  let scoreOne = string.split(' ').reverse()[1]
  let scoreTwo = string.split(' ').reverse()[0]
  return [scores[scoreOne], scores[scoreTwo]]
}
