// What is your favourite day of the week? Check if it's the most frequent day of the week in the year.

// You are given a year as integer (e. g. 2001). You should return the most frequent day(s) of the week in that year. The result has to be a list of days sorted by the order of days in week (e. g. ['Monday', 'Tuesday'], ['Saturday', 'Sunday'], ['Monday', 'Sunday']). Week starts with Monday.

// Input: Year as an int.

// Output: The list of most frequent days sorted by the order of days in week (from Monday to Sunday).

// Preconditions:

// Week starts on Monday.
// Year is between 1583 and 4000.
// Calendar is Gregorian.
// Examples (input -> output):
// * 2427 -> ['Friday']
// * 2185 -> ['Saturday']
// * 2860 -> ['Thursday', 'Friday']

// My solution:
function mostFrequentDays(year) {
    let days = [
      new Date(year, 0, 1).getDay(), 
      new Date(year, 11, 31).getDay()
    ]
    
    if (days[0] === days[1])
      days.pop()
      
    else if (!days[0] || days[0] > days[1] && days[1])
      days.reverse()
  
    return days.map(n => ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wednes', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Satur'][n] + 'day')
}
